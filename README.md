# Demo: Islands üèùÔ∏è

This tech-demo demonstrates a web frontend application written in Go and TypeScript
following the
[Islands of Interactivity](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/)
architectural approach to building highly maintainable modern web applications using
a cutting-edge tech stack:

- **Templating**
  - [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ) for fast and convenient
    server-side templating in Go. üñ®Ô∏è
- **Dev Tools**
  - [Templi√©r](https://github.com/romshark/templier) for hot-reloads in dev mode. ‚ôªÔ∏è
  - [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for TypeScript bundling and JS package management. üçû
  - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript/TypeScript linting. üîé
- **Frontend**
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for easy styling. üíÖ
  - [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style/) for reusable and extensible web components. üëü
  - [Lit](https://lit.dev/) for building maintainable and fast web components. üî•
- **Scripting**
  - [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) for client-side scripting. ‚õ∞Ô∏è
- **CI/CD**
  - [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for CI/CD.

## Prerequisits

- [Go 1.24](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (only when HTTPS is required)

## How To

### Development

Run T√©mplier to enable automatic hot-reload on source changes:

```sh
./dev.sh
```

Then navigate to http://127.0.0.1:7331.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Use http://127.0.0.1:8080/ to access the actual application server without
the Templi√©r proxy (this won't auto-reload on changes).

#### HTTPS

If you want to test the server with TLS enabled,
first add the domain to your `/etc/hosts` file:

```
127.0.0.1 islands.demo
```

Then install [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and run:

```sh
mkcert -install
```

Once the CA certificates are installed, create the certificate and key files:

```sh
mkcert islands.demo
```

Finally, run the server:

```sh
TLS_CERT="islands.demo.pem" TLS_KEY="islands.demo-key.pem" go run ./cmd/server -host islands.demo:8080
```

### Production mode

```sh
# First, build all generated files.
./buildall.sh

# Build server
go build -o server ./cmd/server

# Run server
TLS_CERT="path/to/cert.pem" TLS_KEY="path/to/key.pem" ./server -compress -host hostaddr
```

### Downloading an Icon

This repository uses a subset of
[bootstrap-icons](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.3/icons/).
To copy an icon from the CDN and make it available in the public bundle,
use:

```sh
# This will download the person.svg bootstrap icon.
ICON=person bun run download:icon
```
